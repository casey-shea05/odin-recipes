    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup sesame or peanut oil</li>
        <li>1 small head garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 smaller shallots, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sesame seeds</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons ginger, grated</li>
        <li>1-3 tablespoons crushed red pepper flakes, to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Korean chili flakes (Gochugaru) (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/4-1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>8 ounces rice noodles</li>
        <li>2 bell peppers, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/3 cup tamari or soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh Thai or regular basil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh green onions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In a medium skillet, combine the sesame oil, garlic, shallots, and bay leaf. Cook over medium heat until the garlic turns golden and is crisping, about 5-8 minutes. Stir in the sesame seeds and ginger, cook 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour the oil into a large bowl. Add the chili flakes, paprika, cayenne, and season with salt. I use all of the oil for the noodles, but if desired, reserve half of the oil for serving.</li>
        <li>Cook the noodles according to package directions. During the last 3 minutes, add the bell peppers to the water. Save 1/4 cup water, then drain. Toss the hot noodles, tamari/soy sauce, and all of the herbs with the chili oil, add water to thin to reach desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Serve the noodles with additional chili oil and green onions.</li>
    </ol>
