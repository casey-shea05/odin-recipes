# The Odin Project - Project: Recipes

## ðŸŒ… Context
This is one of the first projects in the foundations part of the programme. This project aims to encourage us to solidify pratice all of the HTML concepts we've touched upon so far such as:

- Tags and elements
- HTML boilerplate code
- Working with text
- Lists
- Links and images

## ðŸŒ± Purpose and Use Case
We're going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. 

The website wonâ€™t look very pretty by the time we're finished. However, itâ€™s important to keep in mind that the purpose of this project is just to build up our base HTML knowledge. 

We will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS!
